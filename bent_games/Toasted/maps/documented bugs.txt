BUG (high priority):
  Level 5's miniboss doesn't move.

COMPLETE: No
BUG (medium priority):
  Level 5's boss overwrites walls and I believe the particle 
  system kills you in one hit AFTER you explode an arm.

BUG (low priority):
  Level 2's boss is displayed by an '@' when it shouldn't
  be.

COMPLETE: No
BUG (medium priority):
  Level 4's boss will move over the player when the boss is in
  the moving state. I believe it might be caused when the boss
  is in its red mode and can take damage.

COMPLETE: Yes
BUG (low priority):
  Level 1's miniboss doesn't seem to be freeing his location
  correctly. Sometimes a clawbot appears where he was.

COMPLETE: No
BUG (medium priority):
  In level 2, if the player shoots the rocket launcher at the door
  he came in, the game crashes.
